\begin{problem}{Zero-complexity Transposition}{zero.in}{zero.out}{2 seconds}

You are given a sequence of integer numbers. \emph{Zero-complexity transposition}
of the sequence is the reverse of this sequence. Your task is to write a program 
that prints zero-complexity transposition of the given sequence.

\InputFile

The first line of the input file contains one integer $n$ --- length of the 
sequence ($0 < n \le 10\,000$). The second line contains $n$ integer numbers --- 
$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-1\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000 \le a_i \le 1\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000$).

\OutputFile

On the first line of the output file print the sequence in the reverse order.
